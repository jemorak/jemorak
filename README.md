# Jemima Orakwue

I am an aspiring software engineer who does not exactly know what to specialise in. Whether that be back-end or front end. I'm currently on a break and have secured a placement at Kainos.

Here are the languages and frameworks that I am familiar with:
- Python
- C#
- PHP
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Laravel
- Node
